## Developing Locally
Do you want the freedom of developing on your local machine without being charged for every helloWorld test call you make? Or maybe you are not feeling ready to put your _helloWorld_ lambda on the big bad internet. Either way, this section can get your local environment ready to go, and you'll be introduced to quite a few AWS topics along the way.

If you are brand new to AWS, this is a great place to start.
